# Artery

  > the internal plumbing of your web application

Artery aims to provide a clean and yet powerful event-driven architecture to create scalable and maintainable applications. Artery's API is greatly inspired by [express](http://github.com/visionmedia/express) and its secret goal is to get the same kind of code on both client and server side.

Artery is framework agnostic and has first-class support for [components](http://github.com/component) (commonjs) but works fine as a standalone/AMD version.


## Overview

You've probably met this guy at work that got on your nerves (to stay polite) and constantly told you to not repeat yourself, test your code and think reusable and maintainable as much as possible. This guy is a pain but you've also spend a lot of time refactoring your application and you know he is right.




## Installation


Artery has first-class support for [component](http://github.com/component) and support other package manager tools such as browserify or bower.

component:

    $ component install bredele/artery

browerify;

    $ npm install artery

standalone:

    <script src="artery.js"></script>
