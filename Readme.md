# Artery

  > the internal plumbing of your web application

Artery aims to provide a clean and yet powerful event-driven architecture to create scalable and maintainable applications. Artery's API is greatly inspired by [express](http://github.com/visionmedia/express) and its secret goal is to get the same kind of code on both client and server side.

Artery is framework agnostic and has first-class support for [components](http://github.com/component) (commonjs) but works fine as a standalone/AMD version.
